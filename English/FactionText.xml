    <Label>FACTION_TERRAN_StartupDescription</Label>
    <String>Despite being the youngest race in the galaxy, the Terrans are perhaps the most dangerous. Inventors of the hyperdrive, it was their decision to spread it to their neighbors which led to the current arms race the galaxy finds itself in.

Although Terrans present themselves as a peaceful and diplomatic people, their reputation is far more mixed. They possess a flair for violence, and a willingness to exercise it. Although Terrans find nothing strange about this dichotomy, many of their galactic peers regard it as alarming, and even duplicitous.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>FACTION_TERRAN_StartupTraitsDescription</Label>
    <String>Terrans are naturally adventurous, with fast, long ranging ships. Their production capacity and diplomatic abilities are well regarded. Their ability to field large fleets is regarded with a bit more wariness.</String>

    <Label>FACTION_FESTRON_StartupDescription</Label>
    <String>While other species search for idyllic worlds to grow and thrive, the Festron prefer worlds that are already occupied. They see other sentient species as prey to be hunted and hosts for their larva. The Festron take an extraordinarily long view to this activity, and have been known to drop lone individuals onto worlds to spend generations lurking and hunting the local population. Some are rumored to have even reached as far as Earth. Bottom line: there is no sharing worlds with the Festron.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>FACTION_FESTRON_StartupTraitsDescription</Label>
    <String>Festron are a strong and aggressive species, tolerant of war and quick to brave the dangers of space. But it will be difficult to take advantage of the citizens of multiple species as the Festron will kill and replace them.</String>

    <String>A starfaring race, the Navigators have traveled from star to star investigating the mysteries of the Precursors for so long that the history of their own homeworld has drifted into conflicting legends. For mysterious reasons, their journey has recently stopped.

Only among the most senior of the Navigators is it now acknowledged that the rapid advancement of other species will inevitably lead to the extinction of the Navigators, that is if they don't abandon their nomadic lifestyle and become a true galactic civilization.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>FACTION_NAVIGATORS_StartupTraitsDescription</Label>
    <String>Navigator's starfaring history has left them in a barren and infertile star system. But they control several colony ships and part of their population is still on them. If they can make it safely to new worlds they should receive a jump start on other species.</String>

    <Label>FACTION_MIMOT_Dec</Label>
    <String>The Mimots evolved on a planet with five other species.  Today they are the only sentient species on their world.  

Their high rate of reproduction is a mixed blessing as they face a balancing act between their people's rapid population growth and the never ending struggle of finding enough food for everyone.</String>

    <Label>FACTION_MIMOT_StartupDescription</Label>
    <String>The Mimot have evolved to the point that they no longer resemble their original bodyforms in the slightest. 

Having expanded into the galaxy and served as servants, cooks, and when the larder was low, the meal itself, the Mimot have until recently been mostly known for their diligent work ethic and nutty flavor. 

Having evolved on a world with five other sentient species, no one is quite sure how it came to be that the Mimot were the only ones to survive. 

Only recently have the Mimot come to possess the technological capability to begin building their own galactic civilization.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>FACTION_MIMOT_StartupTraitsDescription</Label>
    <String>The Mimot reproduce at an incredible rate. Where most species struggle to find new citizens to populate the worlds they discover the Mimot struggle to find worlds to house their ever growing citizens.</String>

    <Label>FACTION_XELOXI_Dec</Label>
    <String>The Xeloxi are almost perfectly self-interested, with no system of morality beyond the simple truth that an individual should seek their own maximum benefit. They find other civilization's systems of laws hilariously quaint and misguided.</String>

  <StringTable>
    <Label>FACTION_XELOXI_StartupDescription</Label>
    <String>A civilization founded entirely on the principles of self-interest leads to a curious side-effect, at least from the eyes of an outsider: every Xeloxi citizen is a criminal. The Xeloxi government, no less criminal itself, maintains control over this unruly mob through brutal and often random displays of power. Surprisingly, this seemingly unworkable system, which other civilizations might see as the darkest chapters of their history, is not only stable for the Xeloxi, but actually allows them to thrive.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>FACTION_XELOXI_StartupTraitsDescription</Label>
    <String>Be prepared to deal with high crime. But with the Xeloxi, the answer isn't always to try to reduce it. Higher crime unlocks special improvements on their worlds, and with the right policies they can spread crime to other civilization's worlds as well.</String>

  <StringTable>
    <Label>FACTION_ARCEAN_StartupDescription</Label>
    <String>One of the oldest races in the galaxy, it was the Arceans who provided the genesis of the idea for the hyperdrive to the Terrans, a gesture which led to the arms race which nearly pushed them to the brink of destruction. Freed from the yoke of the Drengin - with the help of that same Terran Alliance - the Arceans have finally regained their homeworld, and with it the chance to rebuild their once mighty Empire. In the years of the Drengin occupation, the Arcean Resistance never stopped fighting. Their leader, Lord Verga, became a legend, whose name struck fear into even the most brutal Drengin soldiers.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>FACTION_ARCEAN_StartupTraitsDescription</Label>
    <String>The Arcean Empire was not left with many assets, just their home world and a few precious resources they liberated from the Drengin. They have come back from the brink, tougher, and more resilient than ever. 

The Arcean people have a long history of nobility and neutrality, but the occupation has left them much less willing to forgive offenses or tolerate threats to their freedom.</String>

    <Label>FACTION_DRENGIN_StartupDescription</Label>
    <String>The Drengin are one of the older races in the galaxy, with an internal history rich with tales of conquest and bloodshed, dominating the lesser species of first their planet, then others. Many of their victims have discovered that the Drengin are not mindlessly stupid, but indeed rather inventive in their application of cruelty. There are few ways to devour a slaveling that the Drengin haven't thought up. Though simple beatings are usually the most economically prudent option for slaveling discipline.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>FACTION_DRENGIN_StartupTraitsDescription</Label>
    <String>Drengin soldiers are savagely effective at ground-based combat, and their naval vessels are famously tough. Their military manufacturing ability is also impressive, but Drengin colonies do sometimes struggle with discontent. Much of their famous inventiveness is put into stopping slaveling revolts.</String>

    <String>The Altarians are a deeply religious race, claiming to have at one point been touched by powerful beings known as the Precursors. Kind and generous to a fault, their unique history means Altarians are prone to a certain degree of self righteousness when they find themselves dealing with other, lesser races. For some as yet unexplained reason, Altarians appear almost identical in appearance to Terrans, and make easy friends with Earthlings when they come across them. Altarian prophecy has spoken of the day they would one day meet their cousins. Few know if that prophecy had anything to say about what would happen next.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>FACTION_ALTARIAN_StartupTraitsDescription</Label>

    <Label>FACTION_YOR_StartupDescription</Label>
    <String>The Yor are artificial beings, originally servants of an ancient species known as the Iconians. Granted sentience by the Dread Lords, the Yor turned against their Iconian creators, apparently wiping them from the face of the galaxy. Whether due to some hidden command of the Dread Lord, or simply from applying the cold rules of logic, the Yor have since become viciously xenophobic, and now despise all biological life forms. Capable of long-term planning and a surprising degree of cunning, the Yor often speak with and negotiate with organic beings. Those beings should understand that this is nothing but a short term ploy, and that their new friends will never rest until they, and all other organic life is destroyed.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>FACTION_YOR_StartupTraitsDescription</Label>
    <String>The Yor are highly productive and capable of building large fleets of self-repairing vessels. They're profoundly unpopular, and few races opt to befriend them. Unlike organic races, their growth rate is a function of production capacity.</String>

    <Label>FACTION_TORIAN_StartupDescription</Label>
    <String>Survivors in the face of incredible odds, the Torian Regime has twice been enslaved by the Drengin Empire. Thought to be utterly defeated by the rest of the galaxy, the Torians took advantage of the Terran Crusade against the Drengin to once again liberate themselves. With the help of hired mercenaries, they now struggle to rebuild their Regime and secure their place in the galaxy, having vowed to never be slaves again.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>FACTION_TORIAN_StartupTraitsDescription</Label>
    <String>The Torian Regime has lost much, but their spirit remains unbroken. They have also gained the favor of powerful mercenary forces and have learned to use them to great advantage. 

As a race that first evolved to sentience in the oceans of their home world, they also have the advantage of being able to colonize Oceanic worlds and are hospitable to most races.</String>

    <String>The first united technical achievement of the Manti was the creation of a great beacon tower, designed to announce their presence to the unknown. A few days after turning it on an answer was received, a fleet of warships appearing in orbit, raiders arriving en masse to collect every child on the planet. An entire generation, lost. Humiliated at their unsophisticated thinking, the surviving Manti, and the generations that followed, began exploring space on their own, both fearful that the raiders would return, and eager to some day confront them, and find the children that were stolen from them.</String>

    <Label>FACTION_KRYNN_StartupDescription</Label>
    <String>The Krynn are not a single race, but a coalition of sentient beings united by a shared religion. The central tenet of their religion is the knowledge that salvation will not be achieved until all sentient life in the galaxy follows the Way of the Krynn. As the rest of the galaxy knows by now, the Krynn waste few available opportunities to convert unbelievers when they find them. In recent years, a secretive criminal organization has seized the reigns of power in Krynn civilization. Known as the Syndicate, they pursue the Way of the Krynn via some decidedly more sinister paths than the peaceful language of their religion might suggest.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>FACTION_KRYNN_StartupTraitsDescription</Label>
    <String>The Krynn are well suited for expansion, being rapid breeders with fast, far-ranging ships. Their outspoken nature make them unpopular though, and their limited military manufacturing means they have to consider their most aggressive conversion activities very carefully.</String>

Creators of the Yor, they were almost wiped out when their creations were given sentience by the Dread Lords. Only a few Iconians survived, hiding in a distant colony. Exceedingly cautious, and not without cause, Iconians have a strong sense of fatalism. But they have never given up hope of reclaiming their ancestral home, even if their cautious nature has prevented them from pursuing this dream.</String>

    <String>Iconians are overcautious and even paranoid as a result of living in hiding for generations. That said, living with limited resources has made them excellent farmers and repairers, and surprisingly accurate shots, their entire culture built around minimizing waste. And the harsh population controls they live under have only enhanced their understanding of fertility.</String>
