  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>MasterTech_PostSentience_Dec</Label>
    <String>For our entire history we have considered computers a tool, something that we exploit. That simple equation has become unbalanced however, and our relationship with these powerful devices is changing. We are fortunate that they seem to want the same things we do: knowledge.</String>
  </StringTable>

    <String>Improves our research capabilities.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>MasterTech_AIOverseer_Dec</Label>
    <String>Whether it was due to constraints established by our own wisdom, or some hidden system of morality they possess, our AI systems thankfully view us benevolently. But in the field of research at least, it is their direction we follow, not the other way around. And they are never, ever wrong.</String>
  </StringTable>

  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>MasterTech_TechnologicalSingularity_Dec</Label>
    <String>The pace of technological developments has increased to the point we can no longer predict what we will discover next, the curve of knowledge-time bending towards infinity. A generation or two ago, this concept would have sounded terrifying. But now we can see how glorious it will be.</String>

  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>MasterTech_XenoBiology_Dec</Label>
    <String>One of the downsides of living on habitable planets is that other things think they're habitable too. We will have to coexist with the native lifeforms on our new worlds, and we'll need some practice to figure out the best ways of doing that.</String>

  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>MasterTech_XenoConservation_Dec</Label>
    <String>Having studied alien biology for some time now, we can confidently predict the effects out presence will have on it. The effects aren't good. We should labor to protect the environments we find ourselves in, so that they will continue to protect us.</String>

    <String>Reduces pollution on our worlds.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>MasterTech_AtmosphericScrubbers_Dec</Label>
    <String>There's little point to living on a world if we can't breathe its atmosphere. The latest advances in atmospheric sciences should make some of our more challenging worlds far more pleasant to live on.</String>

  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>MasterTech_LandPreservation_Dec</Label>
    <String>As big as the universe is, we shouldn't be wasteful with it. Usable land is still a somewhat precious commodity. A new form of land management will ensure we make the most of it.</String>

  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>MasterTech_XenoAgriculture_Dec</Label>
    <String>If we can't feed ourselves on the worlds we visit, there's little point to being there. The science says our crops should work. But we're going to have to adapt nearly every agricultural technique we have to do it.</String>

  <StringTable>
    <Label>MasterTech_PlanetaryAdaption_Dec</Label>
    <String>We've reached the point where we no longer need to adapt our agricultural needs to meet the local environment, and can now bend the environment to meet us at least halfway.</String>

    <String>Improves the quality of our worlds.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>MasterTech_ColonialCapitalRefit_Dec</Label>
    <String>The capitals of our colonies are makeshift by nature, built on the fly to meet the varying demands of a rapidly growing colony. But by a certain point, they inevitably need to be refit to bring them up to modern standards. This project will do just that.</String>
  </StringTable>

  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>MasterTech_Megapolis_Dec</Label>
    <String>In the early stages of planetary colonization, its natural for our people to spread out, to take advantage of the spaces in front of them. But by a certain point, economic and networking effects necessitate a bit more density. The megapolis is our plan for that.</String>

    <Label>MasterTech_CountermeasureEfficiency_Dec</Label>
    <String>If our countermeasure rounds coordinated their behavior with each other - not all picking the same target for instance - they could prove far more effective. We'll need to rewrite our defensive guidance systems, but this should be within our reach.</String>

    <String>Our enemies are no fools - otherwise they wouldn't be worthy of the title. Their incoming missiles have begun to develop very advanced counter-countermeasures, casting sensor phantoms to trick our countermeasures.

    <Label>MasterTech_SpaceDoctrine_Dec</Label>
    <String>Space isn't just big. It's dangerous. This is doubly true if there are aliens trying to destroy our ships.  Space Doctrine sets up a department in our government designed to organize both public and private industry to work together to ensure our civilization's survival.</String>
