      <Text>We have heard you refer to the Arnor and Dread Lords as the Precursors.  We were the first to discover the subspace streams that connect different parts of the galaxy together.

What is not commonly known is that we didn't invent any sort of technology for this per se. They are not an invention but rather a discovery.  

The subspace streams are, in fact, a natural phenomenon of the universe.  For all we know, there are streams that reach other galaxies entirely.</Text>
      <Text>There are far stranger oddities in the universe than the subspace streams.  For instance, there are dimensional gates that travel between different universes entirely.

We once encountered a species from another universe known as the Arilou who came from a universe with its own storied history.</Text>
      <Text>Long after the Precursors disappeared we were satisfied with simply exploring the universe to find the next great wonder.

Unfortunately, there are far worse things in the universe than the species you refer to as the Dread Lords.  

The ancient creators, known as the Mithrilar, had experimented on many types of creations before they made the Precursors and not all of those things are gone and some, I am afraid to say, are now awakened.</Text>

      <Text>It has been lost to history but it was our civilization that invented the stargates.  

Over two hundred thousand years we invested trillions into the construction of a vast network of stargates.

The stargates allowed ships to travel Hyperspace level 2 between any two of them.  This cut down the travel time of a ship traveling 10 lightyears down to only a little over 3 years.

Of course, the proliferation of the Hyperdrive technology allowed individual ships to travel much faster making our efforts obsolete.  But for tens of thousands of years, this part of the galaxy was ours.</Text>
